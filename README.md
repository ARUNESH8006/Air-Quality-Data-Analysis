# Air-Quality-Data-Analysis
The air quality index is an index for reporting air quality on a daily basis.  In other words, it is a measure of how air pollution affects one’s health within a short time period. The AQI is calculated based on the average concentration of a particular pollutant measured over a standard time interval. Generally, the time interval is 24 hours for most pollutants, 8 hours for carbon monoxide and ozone.
We can see how air pollution is by looking at the AQI

AQI Level	AQI Range
Good	0 – 50
Moderate	51 – 100
Unhealthy	101 – 150
Unhealthy for Strong People	151 – 200
Hazardous	201+
